Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag multiplayer launcher
==

This launcher was created out of my frustration at having to wait so long for the singleplayer version of Assassin's Creed to launch, then press Multiplayer, then wait on it to launch (watching the intro videos again). The launcher exists to force Steam/Uplay/AC4 to launch AC4 directly into its multiplayer mode with no fuss. It can also optionally remove the intro videos for multiplayer (leaving the singleplayer intro videos alone).

Caveats
==

This is only designed to work for AC4 bought and running through the Steam client. If you bought from anywhere else, this program can still work, but you'll have to substitute the Steam-specific instructions with whatever corresponds to how you bought the game. You could also just create a Windows shortcut with the instructions provided by the app and that will work just fine.

How to use
==

Run the program once to give it the paths it needs to work. You'll be choosing
- The path to your Ubisoft game launcher
 - This is probably in your Program Files (or Program Files (x86)) directory under Ubisoft Game Launcher
- The path to Assassin's Creed IV
 - This will be your Steam install directory (or library directory)\steamapps\common\Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag

Once you've filled in both paths, click "Done" and you should get instructions on what to do next. Note that you'll need to keep this program around because it's also responsible for launching multiplayer in addition to configuring it.

Options
==

This program can also optionally remove the multiplayer intro videos if you like. Once you've selected your AC4 executable, the button to toggle intro videos will be clickable. Use this button to easily restore the videos if you decide you'd like to have them back in the future.
